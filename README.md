# E-Wallet
Part of the java - backend internship at VOIS.

The Simple E-Wallet System is a Spring Boot-based web application that allows users to
register, authenticate, and manage their digital wallet. Users can deposit, withdraw, and
transfer funds, while administrators can monitor transactions and manage user accounts.
The project emphasizes secure, layered architecture and real-world financial logic.
